# Implementing-Neural-Network
In this section we will try to build a simple neural network that predicts whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements.The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
